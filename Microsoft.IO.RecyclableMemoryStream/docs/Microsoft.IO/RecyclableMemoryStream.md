# RecyclableMemoryStream class

MemoryStream implementation that deals with pooling and managing memory streams which use potentially large buffers.

```csharp
public sealed class RecyclableMemoryStream : MemoryStream
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Close](RecyclableMemoryStream/Close.md)() | Equivalent to `Dispose` |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Dispose](RecyclableMemoryStream/Dispose.md)(…) |  |
| override [Finalize](RecyclableMemoryStream/Finalize.md)() | The finalizer will be called when a stream is not disposed properly. |

## Remarks

This class works in tandem with the [`RecyclableMemoryStreamManager`](RecyclableMemoryStreamManager.md) to supply `MemoryStream`-derived objects to callers, while avoiding these specific problems:
